# DGButtPlugin

> A Duck Game client for the Buttplug protocol... seriously.

DGBP is a mod for Duck Game which allows for the control of vibrating sex toys by use of the [Buttplug](https://buttplug.io) protocol. It uses the [buttplug-csharp](https://github.com/buttplugio/buttplug-csharp) library as well as the [Buttplug Windows Suite](https://github.com/buttplugio/buttplug-windows-suite).

## Why?

Because a friend and I own Lovense Hushes and decided it would be fun.

## How does this work?

Every time you win, your vibrator power drops by 20%. Every time someone else wins, your vibrator power goes up by 20%. If you tie, nothing happens.

## How do I use it?

1. Install the mod. This can be done by downloading a copy from the [Releases](https://github.com/BytewaveMLP/DGBP/releases) page and extracting the contents to a folder called `DGBP` in `%USERPROFILE/Documents/DuckGame/Mods`. Workshop publishing may come later, but for now, I'll hold off from this for fear of violating the Steam Subscriber Agreement or something.
2. Install the [Buttplug Windows Suite](https://github.com/buttplugio/buttplug-windows-suite) and run "Buttplug Server." Hit "Stop" in the UI, change the port to `6969`, disable "SSL/TLS," and press "Start."
3. Turn on or otherwise power your toy.
4. Launch Duck Game. In the log panel of Buttplug Server, you should see your toy detected as the game starts. If you don't see this, check to make sure your toy is supported by Buttplug.
5. Start an online multiplayer match of Duck Game, and play! You should feel the results if all goes well.
